        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Gülfem Aytekin, a Software Developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Oslo.</p>

        <p>I've been an avid (human) language learner from a young age. When I was trying to decide what career path to take,
        I couldn't think of anything else but something where my language learning enthuisiasm and skills would come in handy.
        That's how I ended up as a Software Developer. Having taken not only computer science courses
        about object-oriented programming, the Semantic Web, natural language processing, etc. but also linguistics related courses in English, German and French at my university,
        I have gotten to indulge in both human languages and programming languages.</p>

        <p>I still love human languages, am excited
        to learn more of them on my own time and possibly even get to incorporate my linguistic skills into my career as a software developer some day.
        For now, I am open to trying any kind of software development.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am working on a hobby project, <a href="../alternative/tarot/index.html" id="machine">a tarot reading machine</a>. I have been painting a deck of tarot cards in my free time,
          and thought it would be awesome to create a program that does tarot readings, using the cards I have painted for the visuals. That way, my developer self gets to collaborate with my hobby-artist self.
          I have written a simple program that draws a random card and displays both the card and the message. I am not yet done painting all the cards, and I am looking to write a more complex
          program when I have the time. For now, feel free to draw from a limited amount of cards!</p>
